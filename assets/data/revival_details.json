        "Revival is the celebration of the innate artist in all of us. It is an online extravaganza aimed at bringing  out the best of dance, music, literature, fine arts and other niche talents which took a back seat due to the COVID pandemic. 2020 left a void in our lives, but now is the  time to leave behind the shadows of the year past, and that take an  artistic escapade to let our creative talents soar.",
        "Revival will mark the “revival” of the campus culture that we all cherish. The guiding principle behind Revival is to bring together the student community of the premier basic science Institutes and exhibit our cultural prowess. The flaming torch in our logo  symbolizes the eternal fire blazing in our hearts. The circumscribing rings embody the united efforts by all the participating institutes in keeping our spirits high.",
        "The organizing consortium includes leading Indian research institutions such as the IISc, the IISERs, the NISER and the CEBS. Revival shall witness participation from all across the country, representing each one of the partnering institutes.",
        "Revival hopes to strengthen our relations, nurture our talents and help us overcome these challenging times together! So come, unleash your creativity!",
